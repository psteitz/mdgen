## Notes
The basic idea of the book is very interesting - the bold thesis that evolution and play are the same thing.  
Nice comprehensive survey of research on animal play.  Lots of kind of rambling side-trips into interesting, but not really message building things like humans impersonating animals.
## Quotes
 * If dreaming is disembodied play, then perhaps play is embodied dreaming. If in dreaming we are playing without our bodies, then perhaps in playing we are using our odies to dream.
